four parameters were excluded from the analysis:

(1) percentage of time between 30 and 50 km/h,
(2) percentage of time with acceleration between 0 and ,
(3) percentage of time with engine speed 2500–3500 rpm,
(4) percentage of time when va was .



Driving patterns registered during aggressive driving (defined as sudden and high acceleration and heavy braking) 
were found to cause several times more exhaust and 30–40% higher fuel consumption than calm driving.


26 driving pattern parameters were investigated in connection with fuel-use and emissions of HC and NOx. Five driving pattern parameters were found to have significant positive effects on all investigated dependent variables. The most important parameters were:

(1) RPA (see Table 3),
(2) number of oscillations/100 m,
(3) percentage of time when acceleration exceeds 1.5 m/s2,
(4) percentage of time when deceleration was between −1.5 to -2.5 m/s2,
(5) percentage of time at speed below 15 km/h.
