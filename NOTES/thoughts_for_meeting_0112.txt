*MPG seemed the highest correlation on one of the papers
*Can we extract an estimate for average MPG based on jerk or accelleration profiles?
*could we just test parts of a trip that would be most likely to have significant variation in signatures?
*Categorize Driver_of_trip into driver style with varying probabilities
*Categorize trips into types
*Give each driver average signature and style
*give each driver average signature for type of trip
*Fuzzy modeling?
