Basic Git Workflow:

//THIS ASSUMES YOU HAVE A CLONE OF THE GITHUB DIRECTORY ALREADY SET UP

ON GITHUB:
	2 branches
		master
		working

When you want to begin working:

ON LOCAL COMPUTER:

-make sure you are in 'working' branch, you can use the command below to double check

	git branch //The current branch you are in should be highlighted or stared

-pull latest 'working' branch from github

	git pull origin working

-create new branch only on local machine to begin work. The name can be whatever, in this example it is newBranch1

	git checkout -b newBranch1

-now you are free to work on the project as normal until your stopping point is reached

-add your changes to be committed:

	git add .

-commit your changes with a brief description of what you did

	git commit -am "message goes in the quotes"

-switch back to the working branch:

	git checkout working

-pull from github to make sure you have the latest working branch

	git pull origin working

-merge your new branch with working

	git merge newBranch1

-fix any conflicts, then push to the working branch on github

	git push origin working

-once uploaded you can delete your extra branch
	
	git branch -D newBranch1

//THIS FLOW SHOULD HELP KEEP ALL OF THE CONFLICTS ON OUR RESPECTIVE MACHINES AND KEEP THE GITHUB 'WORKING' BRANCH CLEAN

//ONCE IN AWHILE YOU CAN MERGE THE WORKING BRANCH WITH THE MASTER IF YOU WANT
